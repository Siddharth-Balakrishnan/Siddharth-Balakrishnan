## About Me
I build backend systems that behave so well you'd think they fear me — and honestly, they should.  
Most days are **Java → Spring Boot → Docker → CI/CD**, plus a bonus Unity session whenever I feel like bullying gravity.  

I enjoy clean architectures, fast deployments, and watching pipelines pass on the first try because it makes me feel powerful — briefly.

**Java, Spring Boot, Postgres, Docker, CI/CD, Linux, Windows, Cloud, Unity**
