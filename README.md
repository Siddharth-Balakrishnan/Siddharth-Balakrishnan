## About Me
If it can be built, I’ll probably try building it before sleeping — and that pretty much sums up how I work.

Most of my projects start with curiosity, scale with design thinking, and end with something surprisingly stable.  
I build end-to-end: APIs, databases, infrastructure, automation, apps, games, prototypes — whatever the idea demands.

I enjoy turning ideas into real, working systems. Whether it’s backend architecture, DevOps pipelines, cloud deployments, or occasional reality-bending Unity builds, I like when all layers of a system cooperate instead of trying to kill each other.

Hackathons, product experiments, and side quests have taught me one thing:  
**Engineering is creativity, structure, and controlled chaos — ideally in that order.**

If you like people who build fast, learn fast, and break things only to rebuild them better… that’s basically my default mode.

## What I Do
- Backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, schema design  
- Build pipelines that deploy fast and fail less  
- Dockerized workloads and automated infra  
- Cloud + OS work across Linux and Windows  
- System design thinking (boundaries, scale, failure modes)  
- Unity / XR when I feel like breaking physics for fun
