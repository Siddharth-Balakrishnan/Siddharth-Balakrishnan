## About Me
Building backend systems that stay reliable, predictable, and slightly more organized than the workspace they originate from has become a personal specialty.  
Most days revolve around **Java, Spring Boot, Docker, CI/CD**, with the occasional Unity prototype thrown in as a reminder that physics has strict opinions.  

Clean architectures, faster deployment pipelines, and systems that run smoothly enough to look intentional — that’s the goal on a good day.
